### Feedback comments

**Knowledge and Understanding weighted (24/30):** You've demonstrated a proficient understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features in Python. Your software design for the assignment includes multiple classes and appropriate driverless car functions. This design showcases elements of encapsulation and abstraction. However, the explicit implementation of other OOP concepts, such as the inheritance principle, is not readily visible in the code.

**Test data used to test the code (27/30):** You implemented the testing using separate classes and unit tests but explicit test data is not visible. Emphasizing the clarity of the test data employed would enhance the understanding of the testing process.

**Structure and Presentation (27/30):** Your code demonstrates a well-organized structure, complemented by a sufficient number of comments that contribute to understanding the logical flow. Additionally, you've provided the purposes of each class, resulting in an overall commendable presentation of the code.

**README file (8/10):** The README file includes a solution description and instructions for code execution. Additionally, class comments are provided in the README file. Very good description of each class is presented which helps to understand the programme. However it would be more useful if you also have mentioned output for each of the class.

It would be beneficial to include details about the testing scheme in the README file. Overall, commendable work.
