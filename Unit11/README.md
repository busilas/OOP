**Introduction and Functionalities:** You've provided a solid introduction to the concept of driverless cars, along with a figure and table detailing their functionalities. It's commendable. However, for clarity and precision, consider separating navigation and control into distinct use cases.

**Use Case Diagram:** Your use case diagram outlines four functions, but it would benefit from further refinement by distinguishing between navigation and control as separate use cases. This will provide a clearer representation of the system's functionality.

**Activity Diagram:** While your activity diagram effectively illustrates the flow of control within the system, ensure that it focuses on a specific use case rather than attempting to encompass the entire functionality of a driverless car. This will enhance clarity and relevance.

**Class Diagram:** Clarify the differentiation between the roles of "user" and "passenger" in your class diagram to better illustrate how interactions with the driverless car are differentiated between these roles. Additionally, provide explanations for your choice of data structures, such as using lists for the Route class and queues for navigation.

**Sequence Diagrams:** Specify any unique aspects or differences between the presented sequence diagrams for Set Destination and Adjust Direction to ensure clarity regarding their purposes and functionalities.

Overall, your work demonstrates a solid understanding of the subject matter. By addressing the areas mentioned above and providing clear justifications for your design choices, you can further enhance the quality and effectiveness of your design document.
