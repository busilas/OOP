<h2 align = "center"> Driverless car system implementation </h2>

This repository contains a Python OOP-based simulation of a driverless car system implementation. It encompasses classes that represent various elements of the system, such as user, vehicle, navigation, sensors, and more.

## Overview

The Driverless Car System is a comprehensive simulation framework that integrates key components, such as environmental perception, passenger interaction, vehicle control, and navigation, to demonstrate how these components collaborate to deliver a seamless and safe driving experience in a simulated environment.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several modules, each responsible for different aspects of the system. Below is a detailed description of each module:
