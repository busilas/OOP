# e-Portfolio activities

In this programming task, the objective is to develop a Python program that manages student and class information, incorporating the use of both protected and unprotected variables. The program consists of two main classes: Student and Class.

### Student Class:

- The Student class represents individual students and contains protected variables for the student's name and grade, ensuring data privacy.
- Additionally, an unprotected variable stores the student's age.
- Methods within this class enable fetching and updating the student's grade.

### Class Class:

- The Class class represents a class or course, with unprotected variables for the class name and maximum number of students allowed.
- It maintains a list of enrolled students.
- Methods facilitate adding students to the class and computing the average grade of all enrolled students.

Key Features:

- Utilization of protected variables (_name and _grade) within the Student class to safeguard sensitive data.
- Usage of unprotected variables (age, class_name, max_students) in the Student and Class classes for non-sensitive information.
- Implementation of methods to add students to a class while respecting the maximum student limit and calculate the average grade of enrolled students.
- Demonstration of the program's functionality through the creation of student and class instances, student enrollment, and output of class information including names of enrolled students and average grade.

This program showcases the practical application of protected and unprotected variables to maintain data integrity and security while efficiently managing student and class information in Python.
