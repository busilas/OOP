# Tutorial Lab 3: Modify Instance Data Members

1. The dot notation we used in the previous lab, to access the values in our member variables, can also be used to modify those values. That means that our objects are mutable, we can change their data.<br>
2. Add this code to the previous labâ€™s code:.<br>

```python
p.first_name = 'George'

print(p.first_name + ' ' + p.last_name + ' weighs ' + str(p.weight_in_lbs) + 'lbs.')
```

3. All we have done here, is use the dot operator to assign a new value to the first name member variable in our Person object. Printing out the second time validates that the change was made to the person referred to by p.

## Program Code

```python

```
