# Tutorial Lab 2: Instantiate a Class

1. Adding on to the previous lab’s code, let’s go ahead and create a new person object and assign some values, then output them to see how to access the member variables.<br>

```python
p = Person('Tom', 'Thumb', 150, 78)

print(p.first_name + ' ' + p.last_name + ' weighs ' + str(p.weight_in_lbs) + 'lbs.')
```
<br>
2. By adding this code to the end of our file, we have created a new Person referred to as p, and then assigned some identifying data to the object for each member data field
<br>
3. The print statement shows how we access the values stored in the instance variable p by using the dot operator. We access each member variable and concatenate the string to produce the output. Recall that weight is an integer value so we need to cast it to string for the concatenation to work.

## Program Code

```python

```
